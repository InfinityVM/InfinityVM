# InfinityVM Book

![infinityvm banner](./assets/infinityvm-banner.png)

InfinityVM is a new blockchain architecture that natively integrates offchain compute.

Applications can run as fully offchain servers that verifiably settle to the InfinityVM base layer. This book covers:

- Building apps with InfinityVM
- Examples of apps
- Coprocessor Node
- Infinity L1

Read the [InfinityVM litepaper](https://infinityvm.xyz/infinityvm_litepaper.pdf) for a detailed discussion of the architecture.

To contribute to InfinityVM, see the [contributing](https://github.com/InfinityVM/InfinityVM/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc for instructions on how to setup the workspace and run tests in the InfinityVM repo.
