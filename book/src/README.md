InfinityVM is a new blockchain architecture that natively integrates offchain compute.

Applications can run as fully offchain servers that verifiably settle to the InfinityVM base layer. This book covers:

- Building apps with InfinityVM
- Examples of apps
- Coprocessor Node
- Infinity L1

Read the [InfinityVM litepaper](https://infinityvm.xyz/infinityvm_litepaper.pdf) for a detailed discussion of the architecture.
