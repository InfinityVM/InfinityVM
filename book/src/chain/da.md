# Data Availability

Infinity implements EIP-4844 for data availability. Most importantly, blobs are finalized in lockstep with beacon blocks, meaning that infinity DA has sub second, single slot finality. The speed and lockstep nature of Infinity DA processing is critical for native coprocessing (more details below). 

DA is gossiped around the network in short lived blobs. Validators guarantee that the blobs will be available for a certain period (normally two weeks and always longer then the fraud proof window). There is a special [blob transaction type](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4844.md#blob-transaction) for the execution layer that contains references to blobs. By having blobs expire and thus not contribute to canonical state bloat, we can make them very cheap.

## Details 

**Block production:** when a validator is creating a block, they send a [engine_forkChoiceUpdatedV3](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/cancun.md#engine_forkchoiceupdatedv3) and then retrieve the payload from the execution layer using [engine_getPayloadV3](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/cancun.md#engine_getpayloadv3). The [response](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/cancun.md#response-2) includes a [blobs bundle](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/cancun.md#BlobsBundleV1). The validator then gossips the beacon block along with the referenced sidecars in a unified bundle.

**Block validation:** validators approving beacon blocks will ensure that they have all blobs referenced by the block stored in a local availability store. The availability store is regularly pruned of expired blobs.

### Coprocessing

The target use case for DA is [offchain coprocessing jobs](../integration/offchain.md); offchain input is stored in blobs that can be used for fraud proofs and general consumption. 

When submitting the results for an offchain job, the coprocessor will convert the offchain input into blobs and reference the blob hashes in the job result metadata. The job manager contract processes the job result metadata and ensures that the blob hashes referenced in the metadata are correctly associated with the block by using the [BLOBHASH op code](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4844.md#opcode-to-get-versioned-hashes). This processes ensures the blob data for job is available in the consensus layer to process fraud proofs.
