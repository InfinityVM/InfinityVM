# Optimistic Payload Building

To improve performance, Infinity optimistically builds execution payloads. This means that when processing a block proposal at height `N`, a validator optimistically requests the execution engine to start building an execution payload for the next block. If they are the next proposer, they can then immediately use this payload in their proposed block.
