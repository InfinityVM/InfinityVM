# Building with InfinityVM

InfinityVM enables developers to use expressive offchain compute alongside the EVM to create new types of applications. This section discusses key concepts for building an app with InfinityVM.

## Overview

The InfinityVM coprocessor works by separating application logic from settlement logic. Application logic can run entirely offchain, giving users the experience of a Web2 server. Settlement (balance transfers or state changes) happens on the decentralized base-layer.

To make this safe and efficient, we utilize zkVMs. A zkVM program is written in a language that compiles down to RISC-V. It accepts any inputs, runs some compute using these inputs, and then returns the result.

Developers define their settlement logic as a zkVM program with a set of public inputs. These inputs come from user input to the application server. The result of this settlement is then used onchain.

The high-level flow looks like this:

1. An app submits a zkVM program to the coprocessor. The coprocessor returns a program ID (unique identifier for program).
1. An app contract or an offchain user/server requests a `job` from the coprocessor. Each job request contains the program ID and inputs to the program.
1. The coprocessor executes this program with the given inputs in a RISC-V interpreter.
1. The coprocessor submits the result (output of program) back to the contract.
1. The app contract can simply use the result from the coprocessor in any of their app logic. A callback function is called on the app contract, which can then execute arbitrary logic.

Importantly, InfinityVM guarantees that the canonical execution chain only contains valid job results. This is explained in more depth [here](../chain/fork-choice.md).

### Using a zkVM Program

A zkVM program can be run in InfinityVM using two types of job requests: **onchain** and **offchain**. Read more in the [Using a Program](./using-program.md) section.

### Examples

We have walked through three examples of building apps with InfinityVM in the [Example Apps](../apps/README.md) section.
