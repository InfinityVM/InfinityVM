# ZKVM programs

This folder contains sample programs for running in the ZKVM executor.

We currently have a risc0 program and an unused sp1 program. 

We intend to [bring back support of sp1][1] and investigate adding support for [jolt][2].

Open questions:

- How should programs handle errors?
- What does developer experience look like for testing programs along side smart contracts?
