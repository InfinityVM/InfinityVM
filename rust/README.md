# Rust workspace

The workspace configuration is defined by `rust/Cargo.toml`.

## Develop

```sh
# set rust version
rustup use 1.79
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

```sh
# install protobuf compilation tools
brew update
brew install protobuf
```

```sh
# build the workspace
cargo build

# lint
cargo lint --fix

# format
cargo +nightly fmt
```

If you are working in VSCode, try installing the rust-analyzer extension. We recommend the following settings:

```
"rust-analyzer.rustfmt.extraArgs": ["+nightly"],
"[rust]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "rust-lang.rust-analyzer"
}
```
