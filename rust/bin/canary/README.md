# Canary OP reth node

This is the ethos chain op node. Its initial configuration is based on This borrows largely for [Reth Alphanet)[https://github.com/paradigmxyz/alphanet].

## TODO

- [ ] look into rethdb-reader - do we need something ecosystem specific?
  - see rethdb build tag in optimism part of book
- [ ] read through engine specs https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/exec-engine.md
