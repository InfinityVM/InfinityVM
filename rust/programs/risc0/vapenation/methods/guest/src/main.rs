//! This is a SUPER SERIOUS ZKVM PROGRAM. It is extremely critical and if you

//! JK! This is just a silly program to demonstrate how to setup a risc0
//! program that can be used with our executor.
//!
//! The stuff in here will be compiled down to riscv32im byte code.
//!
//! Anything that you want to be accessible in the host (i.e. stuff that
//! compiles down to your local arch), must be defined in another crate and then
//! imported,
//!
//! For this example, we are putting shared resources in a `core` crate.
